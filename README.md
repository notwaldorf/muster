# /muster/

Pronunciation: [/ˈmʊstɐ/](https://translate.google.com/#de/en/muster)

Translation: pattern (from German)

This year for my birthday, I received a german [book](http://www.presentandcorrect.com/products/geometric-patterns-book) from the 60s about constructing geometric patterns. Most of the patterns are
made by overlapping smaller, simpler patterns, and it ends
up looking pretty awesome. I don't speak German, but I do speak internet, so `/muster/` is a tool that lets you play with overlapping patterns.

It looks like this, and is built with [textures.js](https://riccardoscalco.github.io/textures/):

The selected patterns are reflected in the URL hash, so you can save and share your patterns!

# <3
You muster send me your patterns!

(I'm sorry. I'll let myself out now.)
